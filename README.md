Our backend is in the backend, and the frontend is in the frontend directories.
the backend will poll the server to collect the newest weather, save to the mongoDB and then will server it to the frontend with a RESTful API.

## Server

the server is found under backend directory. I used express as the framework and MongoDB for the server.

## Frontend

the frontend uses react for the basic components...
